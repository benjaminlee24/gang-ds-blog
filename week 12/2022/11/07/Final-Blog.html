<a class="anchor" href="#question-35" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 35</h2>

<p><img src="/gang-ds-blog/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-08%20at%2011.32.34%20AM.png" alt="" title="35"></p>

<p>This question asked me to select two answers that correctly set the value of maxPS based on the value of time. The answer was A and D but I answered with B and D. I knew that answer D was correct because it used the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time was less than 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise. I though B was correct by having the maxPS to 50 at the end but I didn’t know that having it at the end automatically sets it to 50 regardless of the value. This would mean A is correct because it sets the value to 50 at the start and if it meets the requirements for the IF statement, it runs through it.</p>

<h2 id="question-48">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-48" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 48</h2>

<p><img src="/gang-ds-blog/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-08%20at%2011.43.18%20AM.png" alt="" title="48"></p>

<p>This question asked me to identify which variable had a value of 50 after doing the code segment. The answer was C but I answered with A. I kew that the variable x had a value of 50 because in the fourth line of the code it said that x &lt;- y and y was equal to 50 so that meant x would be 50. However, I forgot the when running the code, the variables change as it goes through the code segments. This led me to think that variable z was only 25 because I forgot that the variable x was changed in the fourth line to 50.</p>

<h2 id="question-49">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-49" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 49</h2>

<p><img src="/gang-ds-blog/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-08%20at%2011.51.16%20AM.png" alt="" title="49"></p>

<p>This question asked me to identify which code segment could be used to store “noon” in the string variable word. THe answer was C but I answered with B. I honestly just misread the answer and thought it said word and not reverse word. This meant that the output would be onon instead of noon. Answer C is correct because it starts with the word on, then it reverses the word to no and then it prints the starting word on to combine to make noon.</p>

  <li>It is important to know and be able to describe the purpose of a computing innovation</li>
  <li>The purpose could be to solve problems, pursue interests through creative expression, etc.</li>
  <li>Truly understanding the purpose of a program helps the developer(s) develop the program better

  <li>Identify inputs/outputs to a program</li>
  <li>Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Some forms can be: tactile, audio, visual, text</li>
  <li>An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program</li>
  <li>Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse clicked, etc. Can be any defined action that affects the flow of execution</li>
  <li>Inputs generally affect the output of a program</li>
  <li>In a program, the code is made in a way that after an action, the code “jumps” to the code segment according to the event</li>
  <li>Program’s output is based off input or prior state

  <li>A program (software) is a collection of program statements the performs a specific task when run by a computer.</li>
  <li>A code segment is a collection of program statements that is a part of a program</li>
  <li>Software needs to work for a variety of inputs</li>
  <li>The behavior is how the program functions during execution and if often described by how a user can interact with it.</li>
  <li>Can be described broadly by what it does or in detail on how the program accomplishes its function</li>
  <li>A program is a collection of statements: A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment, code segments are executed -&gt; a program/software</li>

  <li>Requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, and reflection: may require revisiting phases</li>
  <li>Break the project into smaller pieces and make sure each piece works before adding it to the whole</li>
  <li>Investigate to determine requirements, constraints, concerns and interests of customer</li>

  <li>When developing a program, it is important to cite and acknowledge code segments used from either another source or developed collaboratively</li>
  <li>When acknowledging someone else, include the origin of code or authors name in the program documentation</li>
  <li>Team of people usually work on a program by each focusing on different functional components</li>
  <li>Each member’s work should be credited in program documentation Sometimes credit is given with comments in the code</li>
  <li>Many developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms made by others who aren’t part of the project so it is important to credit them

<p>As I was walking around, I went to another Computer Science group and the AP photography class. Something cool that I saw for the computer science class was that their website was very interactive and I could make comments, like the comments, and generate new quotes. This was very cool to see because I am pretty new to computer science, so being able to see things that I could potentially make in the future is very exciting. For the AP photography class I saw many detailed pictures, but the one that stood out to me the most was a black and white picture of a horse in a field with a mountain in the background. It stood out to me because the horse was perfectly centered in the middle of the photo with a beautiful mountain in the back. The black and white also made the picture stand out because it was the only photo that wasn’t color.</p>
