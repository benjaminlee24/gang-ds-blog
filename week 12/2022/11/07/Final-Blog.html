<h2 id="question-35">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-35" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 35</h2>

<p><img src="/gang-ds-blog/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-08%20at%2011.32.34%20AM.png" alt="" title="35"></p>

<p>This question asked me to select two answers that correctly set the value of maxPS based on the value of time. The answer was A and D but I answered with B and D. I knew that answer D was correct because it used the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time was less than 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise. I though B was correct by having the maxPS to 50 at the end but I didn’t know that having it at the end automatically sets it to 50 regardless of the value. This would mean A is correct because it sets the value to 50 at the start and if it meets the requirements for the IF statement, it runs through it.</p>

<h2 id="question-48">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-48" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 48</h2>

<p><img src="/gang-ds-blog/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-08%20at%2011.43.18%20AM.png" alt="" title="48"></p>

<p>This question asked me to identify which variable had a value of 50 after doing the code segment. The answer was C but I answered with A. I kew that the variable x had a value of 50 because in the fourth line of the code it said that x &lt;- y and y was equal to 50 so that meant x would be 50. However, I forgot the when running the code, the variables change as it goes through the code segments. This led me to think that variable z was only 25 because I forgot that the variable x was changed in the fourth line to 50.</p>

<h2 id="question-49">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-49" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 49</h2>

<p><img src="/gang-ds-blog/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-08%20at%2011.51.16%20AM.png" alt="" title="49"></p>

<p>This question asked me to identify which code segment could be used to store “noon” in the string variable word. THe answer was C but I answered with B. I honestly just misread the answer and thought it said word and not reverse word. This meant that the output would be onon instead of noon. Answer C is correct because it starts with the word on, then it reverses the word to no and then it prints the starting word on to combine to make noon.</p>

<p>Overall, I thought this test was pretty straight forward because I took my time with every question and understood what it was asking me. I also had some knowledge from watching most of the college board videos while taking notes of them.</p>

<p>Here are some of the notes:</p>

  <li>Inputs generally affect the output of a program</li>
  <li>In a program, the code is made in a way that after an action, the code “jumps” to the code segment according to the event</li>

<p>As I was walking around, I went to another Computer Science group and the AP photography class. Something cool that I saw for the computer science class was that their website was very interactive and I could make comments, like the comments, and generate new quotes. This was very cool to see because I am pretty new to computer science, so being able to see things that I could potentially make in the future is very exciting. For the AP photography class I saw many detailed pictures, but the one that stood out to me the most was a black and white picture of a horse in a field with a mountain in the background. It stood out to me because the horse was perfectly centered in the middle of the photo with a beautiful mountain in the back. The black and white also made the picture stand out because it was the only photo that wasn’t color.</p>
