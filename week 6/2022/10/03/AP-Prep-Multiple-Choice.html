  <li>Innovations are improved through collaboration in CSP</li>
  <li>A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function</li>
  <li>Effective collaboration skills: Communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, negotiation</li>
  <li>Computing innovation: reflects the diversity of talents and unique perspectives of all the programers who worked to create it</li>
  <li>Collaboration on projects can reduce bias since there are various perspectives Video Quiz:

  <li>How computing innovations are developed by groups of people</li>
  <li>Consultation and communication between peers is important</li>
  <li>Information contributed from all the group members can help understand the purpose of the program and create one that incorporates all the perspectives</li>
  <li>Online tools can help collaboration such as pair programming</li>
  <li>Pair programming: work together in pairs- the driver writes the code, the navigator reviews it</li>
  <li>Think pair share: students work through a problem alone then pair with a partner then share with class</li>
  <li>It is important to give credit</li>

  <li>It is important to know and be able to describe the purpose of a computing innovation</li>
  <li>The purpose could be to solve problems, pursue interests through creative expression, etc.</li>
  <li>Truly understanding the purpose of a program helps the developer(s) develop the program better

  </li>
  <li>Identify inputs/outputs to a program</li>
  <li>Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Some forms can be: tactile, audio, visual, text</li>
  <li>An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program</li>
  <li>Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse clicked, etc. Can be any defined action that affects the flow of execution</li>
  <li>Inputs generally affect the output of a program</li>
  <li>In a program, the code is made in a way that after an action, the code “jumps” to the code segment according to the event</li>
  <li>Program’s output is based off input or prior state

  <li>A program (software) is a collection of program statements the performs a specific task when run by a computer.</li>
  <li>A code segment is a collection of program statements that is a part of a program</li>
  <li>Software needs to work for a variety of inputs</li>
  <li>The behavior is how the program functions during execution and if often described by how a user can interact with it.</li>
  <li>Can be described broadly by what it does or in detail on how the program accomplishes its function</li>
  <li>A program is a collection of statements: A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment, code segments are executed -&gt; a program/software</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Use a development process to develop a program</li>
  <li>Design a program and its user interface</li>
  <li>A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature</li>
  <li>Common phases when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, testing</li>
  <li>Requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, and reflection: may require revisiting phases</li>
  <li>Break the project into smaller pieces and make sure each piece works before adding it to the whole</li>
  <li>Investigate to determine requirements, constraints, concerns and interests of customer</li>
  <li>Investigate by: collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations</li>
  <li>Requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program should provide</li>
  <li>Design phase that outlines how to accomplish a program’s goal may include: brainstorming, planning/story boarding, organizing the program into modules and functional components, creation of diagrams, develop testing strategy</li>
  <li>Constantly test your program

  </li>
  <li>When developing a program, it is important to cite and acknowledge code segments used from either another source or developed collaboratively</li>
  <li>When acknowledging someone else, include the origin of code or authors name in the program documentation</li>
  <li>Team of people usually work on a program by each focusing on different functional components</li>
  <li>Each member’s work should be credited in program documentation Sometimes credit is given with comments in the code</li>
  <li>Many developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms made by others who aren’t part of the project so it is important to credit them

  </li>
  <li>Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation</li>
  <li>Program documentation: a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed EX: comments (don’t effect how the program runs)</li>
  <li>Should actively document throughout development to help development as well as maintaining correct programs</li>
  <li>Program documentation created to: describe the program, list specifications, describe different parts of the program, list of contributors</li>
  <li>Document process: beginning: list specifications, during: keep track of progress, after: explain overall process</li>
  <li>Documentation improves: programming process efficiency, ability to test and refine program, responding to bugs</li>

  <li>identify an error</li>
  <li>a logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly</li>
  <li>a syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed</li>
  <li>a run time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of the program. Programming language define their own runtime errors</li>
  <li>A overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Identify inputs and corresponding expected outputs or behaviors that can be used to check the correctness of an algorithm or program</li>
  <li>In the development process, testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes
    <ul>
      <li>Programmers use the results from testing to revise their algorithms or programs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes of input data</li>
  <li>Program requirements are needed to identify appropriate defined inputs for testing</li>
</ul>
