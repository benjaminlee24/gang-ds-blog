# What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others.
Concerns I have on the digital divide is that people will become too uncomfortable with human interaction. Bullying is much easier online as people say harmful things online that they would not say in person. Addtionally, people will stay inside on their devices all day long not getting any exercise and living an unhealthy life.#
