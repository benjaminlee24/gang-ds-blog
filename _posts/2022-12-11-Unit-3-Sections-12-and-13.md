# Notes
A procedure call interrupts an execution of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure.

A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.

Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called.

If you have a set of statements and inside there is a procedure then when it reaches that procedure it will excute that procedure and then go back to the rest of the statements.

If you have a set of statements in a procedure the statement will go thought the top of the procedure to the bottom in order.

If you see a return statement you automatically end the procedure even if there is more statements

Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program

Parameters are input values of a procedure.

Parameter: are input values of a procedure

Procedures can be referred to as method or function depending on the programing language.

Procedures are that a catch-all term for codes used to identify what was done to or given to a patient

Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose

There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements

# 3.12 Part 1 Hacks
Problem 1

PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) }

Problem 2

True==

Problem 3

totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) + calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252)

totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint((2451, 118) + (3442, 252))

# 3.12 Part 2 Hacks
PROCEDURE find a ()

{ c – 9

b <– 9 * 9

a <– b * c

Print (a)

}

What is a?

a= 729

cost ⟵ 173 tax - 10%

PROCEDURE applytax (cost, cpercentDiscounted) { temp <– 100 + percentTaxed

temp <– temp / 100

cost <– cost x temp

Print(cost)}

What is the cost?

cost= $190.30

Tempature - 103 Degrees

PROCEDURE convet Fahrenheit (tempature)

{

Celsius <– tempature - 32

Celsius <– Celsius x 5/9

Print (Celsius)}

temperature: 39.4 degrees Celsius

# 3.13 Hacks
#1 Create a procedure that is meant to replace the top running backs yards per game in one season if the current running back has more yards per game

Necessary Parameters: toprbyardspg(100), currentrbyards(1260), totalGames(12)

PROCEDURE Replace the top running backs yards per game in one season if the current running back has more yards per game

If (currentRbYards(1260) > toprbyardspg(100)

toprbyardspg <– currentRbYards

# Reflection 
These lessons were a little difficult at first, but with persistence, I was able to grasp the ideas, which enabled me to correctly respond to the questions. I took a lot away from the presentation because it was amazing.
