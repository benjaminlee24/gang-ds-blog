# Question I missed

## Question 35

This question asked me to select two answers that correctly set the value of maxPS based on the value of time. The answer was A and D but I answered with B and D. I knew that answer D was correct because it used the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time was less than 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise. I though B was correct by having the maxPS to 50 at the end but I didn't know that having it at the end automatically sets it to 50 regardless of the value. This would mean A is correct because it sets the value to 50 at the start and if it meets the requirements for the IF statement, it runs through it.

## Question 48

This question asked me to identify which variable had a value of 50 after doing the code segment. The answer was C but I answered with A. I kew that the variable x had a value of 50 because in the fourth line of the code it said that x <- y and y was equal to 50 so that meant x would be 50. However, I forgot the when running the code, the variables change as it goes through the code segments. This led me to think that variable z was only 25 because I forgot that the variable x was changed in the fourth line to 50.
