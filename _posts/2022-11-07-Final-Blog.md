# Question I missed

## Question 35

This question asked me to select two answers that correctly set the value of maxPS based on the value of time. The answer was A and D but I answered with B and D. I knew that answer D was correct because it used the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time was less than 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise. I though B was correct by having the maxPS to 50 at the end but I didn't know that having it at the end automatically sets it to 50 regardless of the value. This would mean A is correct because it sets the value to 50 at the start and if it meets the requirements for the IF statement, it runs through it.

## Question 48

This question asked me to identify which variable had a value of 50 after doing the code segment. The answer was C but I answered with A. I kew that the variable x had a value of 50 because in the fourth line of the code it said that x <- y and y was equal to 50 so that meant x would be 50. However, I forgot the when running the code, the variables change as it goes through the code segments. This led me to think that variable z was only 25 because I forgot that the variable x was changed in the fourth line to 50.

## Question 49

This question asked me to identify which code segment could be used to store "noon" in the string variable word. THe answer was C but I answered with B. I honestly just misread the answer and thought it said word and not reverse word. This meant that the output would be onon instead of noon. Answer C is correct because it starts with the word on, then it reverses the word to no and then it prints the starting word on to combine to make noon.

# Blog about the quiz

Overall, I thought this test was pretty straight forward because I took my time with every question and understood what it was asking me. I also had some knowledge from watching most of the college board videos while taking notes of them.

Here are some of the notes:
## 1.1 Collaboration Notes
### Daily Video 1
- Innovations are improved through collaboration in CSP
- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function
- Effective collaboration skills: Communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, negotiation
- Computing innovation: reflects the diversity of talents and unique perspectives of all the programers who worked to create it
- Collaboration on projects can reduce bias since there are various perspectives Video Quiz:
### Daily Video 2
- How computing innovations are developed by groups of people
- Consultation and communication between peers is important
- Information contributed from all the group members can help understand the purpose of the program and create one that incorporates all the perspectives
- Online tools can help collaboration such as pair programming
- Pair programming: work together in pairs- the driver writes the code, the navigator reviews it
- Think pair share: students work through a problem alone then pair with a partner then share with class
- It is important to give credit

## 1.2 Program Function and Purpose Notes
### Daily Video 1
- It is important to know and be able to describe the purpose of a computing innovation
- The purpose could be to solve problems, pursue interests through creative expression, etc.
- Truly understanding the purpose of a program helps the developer(s) develop the program better
### Daily Video 2
- Identify inputs/outputs to a program
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Some forms can be: tactile, audio, visual, text
- An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program
- Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse clicked, etc. Can be any defined action that affects the flow of execution
- Inputs generally affect the output of a program
- In a program, the code is made in a way that after an action, the code “jumps” to the code segment according to the event
- Program’s output is based off input or prior state
### Daily Video 3
- A program (software) is a collection of program statements the performs a specific task when run by a computer.
- A code segment is a collection of program statements that is a part of a program
- Software needs to work for a variety of inputs
- The behavior is how the program functions during execution and if often described by how a user can interact with it.
- Can be described broadly by what it does or in detail on how the program accomplishes its function
- A program is a collection of statements: A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment, code segments are executed -> a program/software

## 1.3 Program Design and Development Notes
### Daily Video 1
- Use a development process to develop a program
- Design a program and its user interface
- A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature
- Common phases when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, testing
- Requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, and reflection: may require revisiting phases
- Break the project into smaller pieces and make sure each piece works before adding it to the whole
- Investigate to determine requirements, constraints, concerns and interests of customer
- Investigate by: collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, direct observations
- Requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program should provide
- Design phase that outlines how to accomplish a program’s goal may include: brainstorming, planning/story boarding, organizing the program into modules and functional components, creation of diagrams, develop testing strategy
- Constantly test your program
### Daily Video 2
- When developing a program, it is important to cite and acknowledge code segments used from either another source or developed collaboratively
- When acknowledging someone else, include the origin of code or authors name in the program documentation
- Team of people usually work on a program by each focusing on different functional components
- Each member’s work should be credited in program documentation Sometimes credit is given with comments in the code
- Many developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms made by others who aren’t part of the project so it is important to credit them
### Daily Video 3
- Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation
- Program documentation: a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed EX: comments (don’t effect how the program runs)
- Should actively document throughout development to help development as well as maintaining correct programs
- Program documentation created to: describe the program, list specifications, describe different parts of the program, list of contributors
- Document process: beginning: list specifications, during: keep track of progress, after: explain overall process
- Documentation improves: programming process efficiency, ability to test and refine program, responding to bugs

## 1.4 Copy of Identifying and Correcting Errors Notes

### Daily Video 1 
- identify an error
- a logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly
- a syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed
- a run time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of the program. Programming language define their own runtime errors
- A overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values
### Daily Video 2
- correct the error
- The following are effective ways to find and correct errors
    - tests cases
    - hand tracing
    - visualizations
    - debuggers
    - adding extra output statements
### Daily Video 3
- Identify inputs and corresponding expected outputs or behaviors that can be used to check the correctness of an algorithm or program
- In the development process, testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes
    - Programmers use the results from testing to revise their algorithms or programs
- Defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes of input data
- Program requirements are needed to identify appropriate defined inputs for testing

## 4.1 The Internet
### Daily Video 1
- We have created smaller computers
- Even though it is easier to do now, it is still hard to do it alone
- Computers can receive and send data
- Packet: Small amount of data sent over a network
- Every packet has a source and destination for the information 
- Computer system: A group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose
- Computer network: A group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data (type of computing system)
- Packet switching: A file that is broke up into packets, sent in any order, and reassembled by the recipient's device
- Path: Sequence of directly connected computing devices from the sender to the receiver 
- Routing: Finding a path
- Bandwidth: Max amount of data sent into a fixed amount of time on a computer network

### Daily Video 2
- Internet is a computing network that has interconnected networks the use standardized, open communication protocols 
- To access the internet, you need to connect to a computing device to an Internet connected device
- Protocol: Set of rules that were agreed on about the behavior of a system (they are open)
- Internet was designed to be scalable 
- Information is passed through data streams
- Data streams have data that is in packets
- Packets can be received in order, out of order, or not at all
- IP, UDP, and TCP are all common protocols 
- World Wide Web is a system of links, programs, and files
- HTTP is used by the world wide web and is a protocol
- World wide web uses the internet

# Night of the Museum Blog

As I was walking around, I went to another Computer Science group and the AP photography class. Something cool that I saw for the computer science class was that their website was very interactive and I could make comments, like the comments, and generate new quotes. This was very cool to see because I am pretty new to computer science, so being able to see things that I could potentially make in the future is very exciting. For the AP photography class I saw many detailed pictures, but the one that stood out to me the most was a black and white picture of a horse in a field with a mountain in the background. It stood out to me because the horse was perfectly centered in the middle of the photo with a beautiful mountain in the back. The black and white also made the picture stand out because it was the only photo that wasn't color.
