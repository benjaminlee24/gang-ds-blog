# Reflection
Overall, I think I did really well compared to other tests. I worked well with my whole team to really understand and go over each question. Some of the questions had Riggi and I stumped because of how long confusing the questions are. However, some of the coding questions we actually understood because working together with Riggi it was very easy to go through the code together and figure out either the problem or the output. I believe that I am starting to understand more and more about Computer Science. One thing I think I really struggle on though is having to select multiple answers in the question, as I find those questions to be more tricky and confusing for me. But overall I definitely see improvement from past tests.
