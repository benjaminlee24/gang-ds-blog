# Vocab
Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer.

Iteration: Repeating steps, or instructions over and over again. ( this could be also often called a loop )

Selection: is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available.

# Notes
Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks

Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results

Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem

Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones. Some existing algorithms include: Determining the maximum or minimum value of two or more numbers. Computing the sum or average of two or more numbers. Identifying if an integer is or is not evenly divisible by another integer. Determining a robot’s path through a maze.

Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions

Some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements

Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another algorithm has benefits such as reducing development time, reduce testing, and simplifying the identification of errors.

## Question 5
In order to find the number 69 begin with the middle index and move on to the following numbers by dividing the first and final indexes by two. You continue until you reach number 69.

## Question 7 
[“Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, “Target”, ”Walmart”]

put in alphabetical order

## Question 8
Due to the fact that binary search automatically rules out half of the options with each iteration, it is much faster than sequential search. Since you begin at the middle index, you can either select the group that is higher or lower than the middle index.

# Reflection
These lessons were a little difficult at first, but with persistence, I was able to grasp the ideas, which enabled me to correctly respond to the questions. I took a lot away from the presentation because it was amazing.
