# Test Corrections

## Question 13

For this question I answered choice A of option 1 only of "The author wants to make the e-book available as a free download." Although option 1 is correct, it is not the only correct option because option 3 also is correct. This is because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users, making option 3 correct as well as option 1.

## Question 28

For this question I answered choices B and C. However answer B was incorrect because the code segment will remove only the first 2 characters of oldString. Answer A is correct because to remove the first 2 characters of oldString, this code segment takes a substring starting at position 3. To remove the last 2 characters of oldString, the substring ends at the position that is 4 characters less than the length of oldString (since 4 characters are removed).

## Question 36

For this question I answered choice A of option 2 only, but looking back at it I didn't realize that option 3 was also correct. Code segment II is correct because it correctly assigns "A" when the numeric score is greater than 90, or "B" if the numeric score is not greater than 90 but is greater than or equal to 80, or "C" otherwise. Code segment III is also correct too because it assigns "C" when the numeric score is less than 80, or "B" if the numeric score is not less than 80 but is less than or equal to 90, or "A" otherwise.
