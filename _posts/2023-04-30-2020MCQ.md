# Test Corrections

## Question 56
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-30 at 10 40 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/235412348-24c54eaf-0c7d-43ba-8c55-49df79a6bee9.png">
The answer that I put was A, however the correct answer is actually D, which is Version II requires approximately 5 more minutes to execute than version I. This is the correct answer because Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time. Therefore, this would be the most accurate comparison between the two. 

## Question 59

The answer that I put was B, however the correct answer is actually C, which is The original developer of open-source software provides free or low-cost support for users installing and running the software. This is the correct answer because Open-source software has source code that is released under a license that allows users the rights to use and distribute it. However, there is no guarantee that the original developer of open-source software will provide support for its users. Therefore, this is the why this answer is NOT an advantage of using-open source software.



## Question 62

The answer that I put was A and C, however the correct answer is A and B. The reason it is B instead of A is because Since x OR y evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x is true, true is displayed. However for option C, Since x OR y evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x AND y evaluates to false, false is displayed.


## Question 63
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-30 at 10 41 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111466901/235412441-66ffe160-c658-400f-8acf-efcf8cc675c8.png">
The answer that I put was B and D, however the correct answer is B and A. The reason that it is option A over D is because In order to perform the desired calculation, the selling price, the genre, and the quantity available are needed. The author is not needed. However for option D, the quantity available is needed to perform the desired calculation. The quantity available for each book is multiplied by its selling price to determine the total amount of money received for selling all copies of the book.


## Reflection
Overall, I think I did really well compared to other tests. Some of the questions had Derek and I stumped because of how long confusing the questions are. However, some of the coding questions we actually understood because working together with Derek it was very easy to go through the code together and figure out either the problem or the output. I believe that I am starting to understand more and more about Computer Science. One thing I think I really struggle on though is having to select multiple answers in the question, as I find those questions to be more tricky and confusing for me. But overall I definitely see improvement from previous tests.
