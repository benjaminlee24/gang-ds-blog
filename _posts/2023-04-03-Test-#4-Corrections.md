## Question 26
<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-03 at 10 28 09 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/229583472-a9a44f77-4fa0-4a02-a0e5-0bb8dbb8a84c.png">

I chose option B but it is wrong because no matter if a data file is compressed, it can be restored into its original state. The correct option is D because there are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.


## Question 39
<img width="1437" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-03 at 10 28 51 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/229583622-362d962d-59df-4e66-8ea6-bb1b7b15eb99.png">

I chose option A but it is wrong because the first number displayed must be 1. The second number displayed could be 1 or 2. The third number displayed could be 1, 2, or 3. The last number displayed could be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 1 1 1 1 is a possible output. The correct option is D because In the second iteration of the loop, i is equal to 2. Thus RANDOM(1, i) returns either 1 or 2. So, the output 1 3 2 4 is not possible.


## Question 46
<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-03 at 10 30 46 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/229584009-637bf981-a772-4031-9817-d7cd868b073e.png">

I chose option C but it is wrong because the first call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 5). The second call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (8, 7). The third call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (8, 3). The correct option is B because this code segment draws the three line segments shown in the figure. The first call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 5). The second call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 7). The third call to drawLine draws a line segment with endpoints (1, 5) and (6, 3).


## Question 50
<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-03 at 10 33 02 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/229584446-b052feed-c5e1-4e96-a501-792d32b917aa.png">

I chose option C but it is wrong because algorithm I does not work correctly. In algorithm I, if two people are tied for the earliest birthday, they both sit down when they are eventually paired. The correct option is B because algorithm I does not work correctly. In algorithm I, if two people are tied for the earliest birthday, they both sit down when they are eventually paired. Algorithm II works correctly. Because algorithm II allows both people to remain standing when there is a tie, a person with the earliest birthday is not eliminated. Algorithm II continues until all remaining people have the same birthday, which is the earliest birthday. Algorithm III does not work correctly. Algorithm III chooses the person(s) with the earliest day, disregarding the month. For example, algorithm III will incorrectly determine that a person born on February 1 has an earlier birthday than a person born on January 5.
