<p>I thought I did better this time when it came to scoring because I had understood what was right and what was wrong more than I did the first time. This allowed me to correctly give and take points from the students. One that really stood out to me was submission 2 because they had all of the requirements needed to receive full credit on every part, so I will try and use that as a guideline for myself.</p>
