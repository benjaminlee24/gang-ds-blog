<p>1.Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</p>

<p>2.Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</p>

<p>3.Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</p>

<p>4.Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</p>

<p>5.Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</p>

<p>6.The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</p>

<p>7.Working software is the primary measure of progress.</p>

<p>8.Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>

<p>9.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</p>

<p>10.Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.</p>

<p>11.The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</p>

<p>12.At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p>
