| Vocab     | Explanation |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Sequence  | More than one line of code |
| Static Text | Text that doesn't change |
| Input | Code that is inserted by the user |
| Output | The response the computer generates from the input |
| Scrum Master | Manage scrum board and ensure agile framework is followed, track issues and looks for opportunities for team to improve |
| DevOps | Combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase a team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity |
| Frontend Developer | Develops what users interact with and what the user sees |
| Backend Developer | Develops what goes on behind the scenes, what the user doesn’t see, the technical stuff |
| J.son | Transport information between systems |
| Agile | Practices like pair programming, planning sessions, sprints… |
| Static Text | Text that does not change |
| Sequence | Two or more lines of code |
| Array | Stores collection of multiple items under single variable name |
| append, remove, pop | Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item.
| Condition | Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop.
| Elements [in a list] | An item in a list.
| For Loop | FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated
| Iteration | Repetition of a Process
| Initialization | What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0.
| increment/decrement | Modifies the counter variable after each repetition.
| Indexing / List Index | The position of an element in a list, starting from 0
| Nesting | Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops.
| While Loop | The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met
| algorithm | finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration.
| iteration | repeating steps or instructions over and over again
| selection | a section of code is run only if a condition is met.
| sequencing | outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given
| variable | you can store an actual value, the value of a variable in another variable, the result of an operation, or result of a procedural call
| String | a sequence of characters
