    "3) Using a pseudo-random number generator in a simulation can make it less accurate, so it is better to avoid using one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) In a flight simulation, the least likely factor to be removed for the sake of functionality is imperfections on aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The main difference between an experiment and a simulation is the situation being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) A car company can use simulation to determine the safety of their new car in the event of a crash, as it would be too dangerous to conduct such an experiment on real vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) An environmental group may use simulation to accurately predict the impact of the greenhouse effect on the environment, as it would be harmful to conduct an experiment on the actual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) A teacher can use an experiment to find the average score on a final exam, as this will simply involve calculating the average and does not require simulation."
