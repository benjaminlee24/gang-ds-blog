    "- What is a database schema?\n",
    "    - A database schema is the structure or blueprint that defines how data is organized in a database. It defines the tables, fields, relationships, and constraints of a database, and provides a clear and comprehensive view of the data model that an application or system uses to store and manage data.\n",
    "- What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database?\n",
    "    - In SQL databases, an identity column is a special type of column that automatically generates unique numeric values for each row that is inserted into a table. The purpose of an identity column is to provide a unique identifier for each row in the table, without requiring the user to manually enter a value for that column.\n",
    "- What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?\n",
    "    - In SQL databases, a primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The purpose of a primary key is to ensure that each row in the table can be uniquely identified and retrieved, and that the data in the table is organized and structured in a consistent and efficient manner.\n",
    "- What are the Data Types in SQL table?\n",
    "    - Some example types are booleans, blob, string, integer, and binary."
