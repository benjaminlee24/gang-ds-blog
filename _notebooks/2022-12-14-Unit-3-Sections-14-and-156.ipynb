    "I gained knowledge about APIs, libraries, and documentation. The AP Exam project portion includes documentation, which entails describing what and how your code does its thing. Because libraries are pre-written and you can reference them throughout your code, they serve to make coding more effective. In programs, randomization can be quite helpful. Many of the programs that we use, such games and webpages, use randomization."

    "The first line of code imports the random library. The software then gathers names from user input and compiles them into a list (names). The number of items in the list is then determined by the variable num items. Using a random number generator, the random choice variable creates an index for the list. The random.randint function is used by random choice to provide a value from 0 to the maximum index (length of list minus 1). Then the software identifies the individual who is connected to the value that was generated at random. The name of that person is then printed by the application.\n",
