<h2 id="program-purpose-and-function">
<a class="anchor" href="#program-purpose-and-function" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Purpose and Function</h2>

<p>I’ll need to have a strong understanding of my actions in order to get this point. To accomplish this, I must stop whenever I find myself typing code that I do not fully comprehend and attempt to understand its meaning before continuing. I can take notes on College Board videos, as Bria mentioned, and if I need more help, I can watch Khan Academy, which has a ton of more information.</p>

<h2 id="data-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#data-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Abstraction</h2>

<p>In order to complete the two code segments to the best of my ability, it will be essential that I put a lot of time and attention into this project. My code must function flawlessly and be aesthetically pleasing for the viewers.</p>

<h2 id="managing-complexity-and-procedural-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#managing-complexity-and-procedural-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Managing Complexity and Procedural Abstraction</h2>

<p>I need to establish the practice of doing more when I code rather than just the minimum level. I often have self-doubt because I’m a beginner coder, but I need to step outside of my comfort zone and begin experimenting with more complex code and hacks. Instead of settling for 2.7 points on the weekly grade, I can start by shooting for 2.7+.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm-implementation">
<a class="anchor" href="#algorithm-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithm Implementation</h2>

<p>I must learn how to write my code more effectively.  I will become more proficient at using algorithms and as a result, allowing the computer to perform more tasks for me. </p>

<h2 id="testing">
<a class="anchor" href="#testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>

<p>I can get better at this by starting to write posts that describe my code and what it accomplishes. By doing this, I will be able to clearly explain code so that the person evaluating my assignment will be able to tell that I know what I am talking about.</p>

<h2 id="possible-ideas">
<a class="anchor" href="#possible-ideas" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Possible Ideas</h2>

<p>I am not completely sure what my project is going to be, but I know that I want to to be fun and educational at the same time.</p>
