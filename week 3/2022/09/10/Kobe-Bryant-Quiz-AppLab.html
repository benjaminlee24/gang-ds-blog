<p><strong><a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/eXy_yOmPrXgG1G-CnEAlxFo-5pTv3VZRFwShlB8mvdA/edit">Kobe Bryant Quiz</a></strong></p>

<h1 id="planning">
<a class="anchor" href="#planning" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Planning</h1>

<p>I planned to make two quizzes in one about Kobe using AppLab on code.org. I will have an easy quiz and a hard quiz that both have 3 questions with 4 multiple choice answers. After every question it will tell you if you got the question right or wrong and display your score at the end of the quiz.</p>

<h1 id="successes">
<a class="anchor" href="#successes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Successes</h1>

<p>Both of the quizzes that provided immediate feedback on whether the user answered a question correctly or incorrectly were ones that I was able to implement. The user could retake the quiz as many times as they wanted after finishing it, and all of the questions worked without a problem.</p>

<h1 id="challenges">
<a class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h1>

<p>One issue I had was that I couldn’t get the quiz’s final result to show up. This was the only aspect of my original plan that I was unable to complete. While creating the quiz, I encountered more issues, such as buttons that led to the incorrect screen because I had mislabeled them. It took me some time to identify which buttons had incorrect labels and to change them to the correct ones.</p>

<h1 id="discoveries">
<a class="anchor" href="#discoveries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Discoveries</h1>

<p>I had no prior experience with AppLab or Code.org before this assignment. I feel a great amount more comfortable using the software now that I’ve created the quiz and worked through a few problems. Although I recognize that this is basic difficulty, it will probably help me advance in my computer science career.</p>
