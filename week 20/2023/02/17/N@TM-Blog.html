Walking into a photography 1, I wasn’t expecting to see the best of the best images, but I was really surprised on how amazing the photos were. This photo really stood out to me not only because it is of me, but because it is a very good action shot picture. I also like how you can tell that it is edited because of the different lighting that allows me to pop in the photo, which was something that the other students didn’t do with their editing.</p>

Ceramics might have been the most unique and interesting room that I went into during the night of the museum because everything was so different and unique from each other. It really showed people’s creativity in a very cool way. The one that stood out to me the most was the dinosaur cup. This is because it was very creative and it caught my eye because it was the tallest project at the table, so my eyes naturally gravitated towards it. Even though it wasn’t completely finished, it was still very cool and stood out to me the most.</p>

With the limited amount of time I spent in the computer science area, a project that stood out to me was Joselyn’s group because their feature was very cool and worked. When I added a city to her searchbar, it would give the details about it such as the weather.</p>

<p>I think that overall Night at the Museum was very interesting and unique this trimester with all of the cool things that were being displayed. Even though we didn’t have our project completely done at the time, it was still fun walking around and looking at everybody’s hard wark and dedication this trimester throughout all of the fine arts classes.</p>
